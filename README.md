# Text-to-Speech Conversion

## Project Overview
The Text-to-Speech (TTS) Conversion app converts text into natural-sounding speech, supporting multiple languages and voices. This app allows users to input text and hear it spoken aloud, with customizable voice options (gender, language, and pitch). It can be useful for a variety of applications, such as accessibility tools, language learning, and content consumption.

## Objective
- Build a TTS app that can convert any input text into speech.
- Support multiple languages and voices, including different accents and genders.
- Allow users to adjust the speech rate, pitch, and volume.
- Provide an easy-to-use interface for text input and control over speech settings.

## Technologies and Libraries
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** – For text-to-speech conversion in multiple languages.
  - **pyttsx3** – An offline TTS library for generating speech in various voices and languages.
  - **Tkinter** – For building the user interface.
  - **SpeechRecognition** – To allow the app to accept speech input, if desired.
  - **Pydub** – For handling and manipulating audio files.

## Implementation
### Key Steps:
1. **User Interface**:
   - The app provides a simple text box where users can enter the text they want to convert to speech.
   - Controls to adjust the speech rate, pitch, volume, and choose between different languages and voices are provided.

2. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**:
   - The app uses **gTTS** for online speech generation in multiple languages, or **pyttsx3** for offline conversion.
   - Users can choose from several pre-installed voices and accents based on the available language.

3. **Audio Playback**:
   - After generating the speech, the app plays it back to the user in real-time.
   - The generated speech is also saved as an audio file (e.g., MP3 or WAV) for future use.

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Voice selection: Users can choose between male and female voices for supported languages.
   - Adjustable speed and pitch: The user can modify the rate at which the text is read and adjust the pitch of the voice.
   - Language support: The app includes multiple languages, such as English, Spanish, French, German, and more.

## Results
- **Text-to-Speech Accuracy** – The app successfully converts text input into clear, natural-sounding speech.
- **Customization Options** – Users can control the voice, speed, pitch, and language of the speech output.
- **Multi-Language Support** – The app supports multiple languages and different voice options for each language.
